# The ACT standard library

Once the core ACT tools have been installed, this is the next package that should be installed. 
This package contains a number of standard definitions for data types, channels, global variables, and basic functions
that will be installed in `$ACT_HOME/act`. This path is part of the default search path for any ACT tool.

The comments in the `.act` files have some basic documentation. Additional
documentation is available as part of the [ACT documentation effort](https://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php?id=stdlib:start).

## Installation

Set `$ACT_HOME` to the root of your ACT installation, and then run `make install`
